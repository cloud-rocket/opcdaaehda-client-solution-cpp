<p>The ability of OPC clients and servers to remotely interconnect - i.e have the OPC client application running on one computer and the OPC server on another - is quite powerful and is the enabler for many interesting applications. However, therein lies a hidden issue - Distributed COM, or as it is more commonly
  known - DCOM. DCOM is often one of the stumbling blocks for new OPC users. So new users should take note that there are some important details to be concerned
  with when setting up a system for remote OPC connections. Be aware that it may be necessary to enlist the services of a network administrator, in order to
  safely and effectively set up the required configurations.</p>
<p>Most OPC servers include detailed instructions for setting up DCOM, because each DCOM configuration is potentially slightly different, therefore we chose
  not to include definitive information on DCOM in our OPC client documentation. As a general note, you would be wise to disable any firewall for testing
  purposes - that is often the source of problems. It is also a good idea once your DCOM security settings have been set and you are successfully reading and
  writing OPC data remotely, to confirm the integrity of your network and PCs from a security standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Most of this section is a compilation of several sources found on the internet. This section&nbsp;is not intended to be a
  substitute for good knowledge of the Microsoft Windows user accounts and security model. It's intention is to&nbsp;point out some key things you need to have
  setup before you even try to configure a DCOM connection between an OPC client and an OPC server. Links to sources where you can get more information are given
  below. Some of the information pointed out here can also be found elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
\section sample_server Sample Server
<p>The included sample server is for development purposes only and should not be distributed with your application. It is an evaluation version server only !
<p>
<ol>
  <li value="1">OpcDaAeServer.exe - OPC DA and AE Sample Server</li>
  <li value="2">OpcHdaServer.exe.exe - OPC HDA Sample Server</li>
</ol>
<p> You can find the server files in the Win32 directory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\\Win32\\OpcDaAeServer.exe is a 32bit server supporting OPC DA/AE for use on 32bit or 64bit operating systems.</li>
  <li>\\Win32\\OpcHdaServer.exe is a 32bit server supporting OPC HDA for use on 32bit or 64bit operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Register/Unregister the OPC Server</h3>
<ol>
  <li value="1">Register<br/>
    You can use the following command to register the OPC Server: OpcDaAeServer.exe -regserver or OpcHdaServer.exe -regserver</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li value="2">Register as Service<br/>
    You can use the following command to register the OPC Server as service: OpcDaAeServer.exe -service or OpcHdaServer.exe -service</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li value="3">Unregister<br/>
    You can use the following command to unregister the OPC Server: OpcDaAeServer.exe -unregserver or OpcHdaServer.exe -unregserver</li>
</ol>

\section server_configuration DCOM Configuration on OPC Server PC

<p>First of all, refer to your OPC server documentation, or contact your vendor for information about setting DCOM security for your particular OPC server. The
  information below is intended for general reference and should not be taken as 100% accurate in all cases. No responsibility is taken for the application or
  misapplication of the information presented.</p>
<p>The following settings will enable Windows NT or Windows 2000 to communicate with an NT or Windows client and back (assuming that there are no firewalls or
  proxy servers involved).</p>
<p>To configure your OPC Server on an NT or Windows 2000 machine, follow the steps given below. Note that DCOMCNFG will only show servers that are EXEs. It
  will not show DLL servers. In the case of DLL servers, carefully consult the OPC server documentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the Windows task bar -&gt; Start -&gt; Runâ€¦ then type in DCOMCNFG.EXE to launch the DCOM configurator.</li>
  <li>From the Applications tab, select the DCOM Server application (which will be represented by its ProgID - a friendly name, such as
    "Technosoftware.DaSample.6") or by its CLSID (a GUID - Globally Unique Identifier) such as {5BD7512F-3F2B-11D0-B4D2-02E0C911A7B1}).</li>
  <li>Double-click the Server application or click the Properties button to view the properties of the server application.</li>
  <li>Select the Security Tab.</li>
  <li>Make the following changes:<br />
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The following changes will allow anyone at all to launch the server. These settings are just for getting the servers up and running in
    development mode for debugging purposes. They are not intended for specific DCOM security on a target platform distribution.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
  <pre>
CUSTOM ACCESS PERMISSIONS:
   Everyone    -    allow access
   System      -    allow access
   Interactive -    allow access
CUSTOM LAUNCH PERMISSIONS:
   Everyone    -     allow launch
   System      -     allow launch
   Interactive -     allow launch
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Select the Identity Tab, and then select "The Interactive User."</p>
<p> Click OK, and then click OK again.</p>
<p> Since your OPC server is raising events to your clients and using client callbacks, then you will also need to make the following changes to the default
  settings for your NT or Windows 2000 'Server' machine: Using DCOMCNFG.EXE, select the Default Properties Tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Set the Default Authentication Level to "None."</li>
  <li> Set the Default Impersonation Level to "Identify."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Make sure you test your DCOM application where the client and the server are running under different user accounts.</p>
<p>If your application works at this point, then you should not need to make any configuration settings on the client machines.</p>

\section client_configuration DCOM Configuration on OPC Client PC

<p>If your client is receiving events raised from the server or has enabled the server to call it back, then the following steps might be necessary, depending
  upon your specific network:</p>
<p>To configure your OPC Clients: Using DCOMCNFG, select the Default Properties Tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Set the Default Authentication Level to "None."</li>
  <li> Set the Default Impersonation Level to "Impersonate."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Modifying and setting security settings should be done with caution and awareness. Before modifying security settings, be sure that you understand the
  security implications involved. The above client settings are only necessary in certain network situations and can be added via setup code to the clients
  registry. For more information about writing such code see the references in the Further Information section later in this article.</p>
