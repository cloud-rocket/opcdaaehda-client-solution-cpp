<!--OPC DA/AE/HDA Client Ssolution C++ Manual-->   
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The OPC DA/AE/HDA Client Ssolution C++ offers a fast and easy access to the OPC Client technology. Develop OPC DA/AE/HDA compliant Clients with C++ for Windows.</p>
\image html ClientCPPDevelopment.png
<p>Under Windows clients using the OPC DA/AE/HDA Client Ssolution C++ supports OPC DA, OPC AE and OPC HDA.</p>
<p>The OPC DA/AE/HDA Client API defines classes which can be used to implement an OPC client capable to access OPC DA, AE and HDA servers with the same API. These classes manage client side state information; provide higher level abstractions for OPC tasks such as managing sessions and subscriptions or saving and restoring connection information for later use.</p>
<p>A large set of sample Clients can be used as reference on how to implement different use cases. Supported compiler is Visual Studio 2017.</p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clients are fully compliant to OPC DA 2.05 ,OPC DA 3.0, OPC AE 1.10,OPC HDA 1.10 and OPC HDA 1.20 servers.</li>
  <li>Clients supports partially OPC HDA 1.20 servers.</li>
  <li>Simplyfies the differences between the specifications by specifiying a unified API. </li>
  <li>Easy to understand and well documented sample clients show how to use the API.</li>
  <li>Source of several sample clients included showing different use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>In general Technosoftware GmbH supports all Windows platforms. But actively tested and supported are only the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 10.0 (32bit and 64bit) - Personal Edition, Developer Edition, Ultimate Edition, Source Edition</li>
