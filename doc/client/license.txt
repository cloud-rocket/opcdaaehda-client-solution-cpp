<p>TECHNOSOFTWARE provides different licenses depending on the component and on the ownership of a purchased license of the user of the sources. A single ZIP
file or a single repository can contain multiple components where the sources have different license models. The valid license is in the header of each source
file.</p>

<p>Following are basic rules on how TECHNOSOFTWARE licenses the different components:</p>

<p>1. OPC DA/AE/HDA and OPC UA core components follow a dual-license model:<br />
&nbsp; - Owner of a purchased license:&nbsp;<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/Source_Code_License_Agreement.pdf">SCLA 1.0</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enables Owner of a purchased license to deploy their applications using the core component sources without being required to disclose the
application code.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - Users that are not Owner of a purchased license:&nbsp;<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/GPLv3License.txt">GPL 3.0</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the GPL 3.0 license terms these users must disclose their application code when using the core component sources.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Samples and Utilities:</p>

<p>&nbsp; - All samples and most of the utilities are provided under the [<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/MITLicense.txt">MIT</a>]&nbsp;license for
everyone.<br /></p>
